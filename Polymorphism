open class Animal(val name: String) {
    open fun makeSound() {
        println("The animal is making a sound")
    }
}

class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("The dog is barking")
    }
}

class Cat(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("The cat is meowing")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val dog = Dog("Buddy")
    val cat = Cat("Kitty")

    val animals = arrayOf(dog, cat)

    for (animal in animals) {
        animal.makeSound()
    }
}
/
In this example, the Dog and Cat classes are derived from the Animal class.
The Dog and Cat classes have their own implementation of the makeSound() method which overrides 
the method with the same name in the Animal class. The main() function creates an array of animals that contains both dogs and cats. 
The for loop iterates over each animal in the array and calls its makeSound() method.
