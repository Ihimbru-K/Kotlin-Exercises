class Person(private val name: String, private val age: Int) {
  fun getName(): String {
    return name
  }

  fun getAge(): Int {
    return age
  }
}
/
In this example, the name and age properties are marked as private, 
which means they cannot be accessed from outside the class. 
The getName() and getAge() methods are used to access these properties from outside the class.
