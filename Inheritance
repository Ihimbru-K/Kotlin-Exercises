open class Animal(val name: String) {
    open fun makeSound() {
        println("The animal is making a sound")
    }
}

class Dog(name: String) : Animal(name) {
    override fun makeSound() {
        println("The dog is barking")
    }
}
/
In this example, the Dog class is derived from the Animal class. 
The Dog class inherits all the properties and methods of
the Animal class and also has its own method makeSound()
which overrides the method with the same name in the Animal class1.
